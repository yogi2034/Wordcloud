# Word Cloud Generator

This Python script generates a word cloud based on the text content of a file uploaded by the user. The word cloud visually represents the frequency of different words in the text, with more frequently occurring words appearing larger in the cloud.

## Installation

To run this script, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:


## Usage

1. Place the Python script in your working directory.

2. Run the script using a Python interpreter or a Jupyter Notebook.

3. The script will prompt you to upload a text file. Click the "Choose File" button and select the desired text file from your local machine.

4. Once the file is uploaded, the script will process the text and generate a word cloud.

5. The generated word cloud will be displayed in a separate window or output area, depending on your environment.

## Customization

You can customize the behavior of the script by modifying the following parts:

- **Uninteresting Words**: The `uninteresting_words` list contains words that will be excluded from the word cloud generation. Modify this list to remove or add words as needed.

- **Appearance**: You can modify the appearance of the word cloud by passing additional parameters to the `WordCloud` constructor. Refer to the documentation of the `wordcloud` package for more details.

## Dependencies

The script relies on the following Python packages:

- `wordcloud`: Generates the word cloud visualization.
- `matplotlib`: Displays the word cloud image.
- `fileupload`: Provides the file upload widget for Jupyter Notebook.
- `pillow`: Required for image processing operations.
